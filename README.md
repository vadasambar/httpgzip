# httpgzip

Httpgzip offers a Custom Resource to enable http gzip compression for your services in a Kubernetes cluster (with Istio installed) without having to understand the complexities of Envoy and Istio. It uses Istio's [`EnvoyFilter`](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/envoy-filter/) custom resource under the hood. 

### *Note: `httpgzip` has been tested with `1.14.0` version of Istio*
Please [create an issue](https://github.com/vadasambar/httpgzip/issues/new) and mention `@vadasambar` if you want to use this controller for other versions of Istio.

## Custom resource
```yaml
apiVersion: apps.vadasambar.com/v1alpha1
kind: HttpGzip
metadata:
  name: httpgzip-sample
spec:
  applyTo:
    # supports [gateway, pod]
    kind: pod
    # apply gzip compression to the kind with the following labels
    selector:
      app: productpage
```
Above creates an `EnvoyFilter` resource which looks like [this](./testfiles/envoy_gateway_filter.yaml
) for Istio Gateways and like [this](./testfiles/envoy_pod_filter.yaml) for K8s Pods.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) or [K3D](https://k3d.io/v5.4.3/) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/httpgzip:tag
```
	
2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/httpgzip:tag
```
^ this installs `CustomResourceDefinition`s as well.

3. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## FAQ
### How do I test if the EnvoyFilter works?
1. You can create a k3d cluster with LoadBalancer like this:
```
k3d cluster create mycluster -p "8082:80@loadbalancer" --k3s-server-arg "--kube-proxy-arg=conntrack-max-per-core=0"  --k3s-agent-arg "--kube-proxy-arg=conntrack-max-per-core=0" --agents 5 --registry-create
```
`8082:80@loadbalancer` exposes LoadBalancer at 8082 port of localhost (check [official docs](https://k3d.io/v5.4.3/usage/exposing_services/) for more info).  
2. Map your host name in VirtualService/Gateway to 127.0.0.1 in etc/hosts like this:
```
suraj@suraj:~$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.0.1	helloworld.com
127.0.0.1	bookinfo.com
...
```
3. Access the host in browser using url like `http://bookinfo.com:8082/productpage` 
4. Check the response headers in browser developer tools to see if gzip is enabled or not.

## Contributing
Any contributions are welcome! This project uses Operator Framework. If you find any issues, 
- Create an issue and mention `@vadasambar` OR
- Raise a PR and mention `@vadasambar`.

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
